            <h3>About us</h3>

            The DST CPR at NISER will primarily focus on different aspects of Energy Transition. The CPR will focus on
            how to devise appropriate policy measures to increase the production and adoption of clean energy at
            household and firms and office spaces. The CPR will review the existing policy measures and empirical
            studies to find out the effectiveness of these policy measures to increase the production of clean energy
            and suggest appropriate policy measures in this regard. Policy measures adopted by the major clean energy
            producers of the world will be reviewed to examine the feasibility of the adoption of these policies in the
            Indian context. The CPR will focus on eastern India covering Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh,
            Jharkhand. It will interact with the energy department, science and technology departments and all
            stakeholders of the energy sector of all these states and national ministries to find out the challenges
            faced by these states. Based on the peer review of global literature on energy transition it will suggest
            suitable policy intervention to increase the production and adoption of clean energy by all sections of the
            society. It has started operating since April 2023.

            <h3>Broad Objectives</h3>
            The broad objectives of the DST-CPR at NISER will be as follows:
            <li>To assess the Nature and determinants of energy transition in India. We shall examine the effectiveness
                of the policy measures in promoting clean energy production. We shall assess the implications of phasing
                out of coal on the coal producing states in eastern India and suggest appropriate policy measures.
            </li>
            <li>To examine the reasons behind the low transition rate of tribal children to higher and technical
                education in the eastern Indian states. We shall examine the association between the access to
                infrastructure, implementation of Forest Rights Act and the educational achievement of tribal children.
                We shall examine the effectiveness of technological intervention such as (ICT) for tribal education and
                suggest measures to improve them.
            </li>
            <li> To examine the sectoral innovation structure in energy transition and tribal education. To evaluate the
                innovations taking place in the field of energy transition and tribal education and suggest necessary
                policy recommendations to strengthen the sectoral innovation systems. The DST CPR will critically
                evaluate the policy interventions, interact with all stakeholders (researchers, manufacturers, sellers,
                and end users) to come up with appropriate policy suggestions.
            </li>
            <li>To leverage data science in understanding large heterogeneous data and identifying correlations between
                them. We shall use machine learning techniques to find the indicators as well as impacts of the policies
                on energy transition as well as suggest new policy measures based on the feedback received.
            </li>
