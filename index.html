            <h3>About us</h3>
            The DST CPR at NISER aims to examine and suggest policy measures to increase the production and adoption of
            clean energy in eastern India, including Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand. It will
            review existing policy measures and empirical studies, as well as policies adopted by major clean energy
            producers globally, to suggest appropriate policy interventions. The CPR will interact with stakeholders in
            the energy sector of these states and national ministries to identify challenges and suggest suitable policy
            interventions based on global literature on energy transition. It began operating in April 2023.
            <!-- <p>
                The DST CPR at NISER will primarily focus on different aspects of Energy Transition. The CPR will focus
                on
                how to devise appropriate policy measures to increase the production and adoption of clean energy at
                household and firms and office spaces. The CPR will review the existing policy measures and empirical
                studies to find out the effectiveness of these policy measures to increase the production of clean
                energy
                and suggest appropriate policy measures in this regard. Policy measures adopted by the major clean
                energy
                producers of the world will be reviewed to examine the feasibility of the adoption of these policies in
                the
                Indian context. The CPR will focus on eastern India covering Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh,
                Jharkhand. It will interact with the energy department, science and technology departments and all
                stakeholders of the energy sector of all these states and national ministries to find out the challenges
                faced by these states. Based on the peer review of global literature on energy transition it will
                suggest
                suitable policy intervention to increase the production and adoption of clean energy by all sections of
                the
                society. It has started operating since April 2023.

            <h3>Broad Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To assess the Nature and determinants of energy transition in India, evaluate the effectiveness of policy measures in promoting clean energy production, assess the implications of phasing out coal in eastern India, and suggest appropriate policy measures.</li>
                <li>To examine the reasons for the low transition rates of tribal children to higher and technical education in the eastern Indian states, evaluate the association between access to infrastructure, implementation of the Forest Rights Act, and educational achievement of tribal children, assess the effectiveness of technological interventions such as ICT, and suggest measures to improve them.</li>
                <li>To examine the sectoral innovation structure in energy transition and tribal education, evaluate the innovations taking place in the field of energy transition and tribal education, and suggest necessary policy recommendations to strengthen the sectoral innovation systems.</li>
                <li>To leverage data science in understanding large heterogeneous data, identify correlations between them, use machine learning techniques to find the indicators as well as impacts of policies on energy transition, and suggest new policy measures based on the feedback received.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The DST CPR will critically evaluate policy interventions, interact with all stakeholders (researchers, manufacturers, sellers, and end-users), and come up with appropriate policy suggestions.</p>
            <!-- <p>
                The broad objectives of the DST-CPR at NISER will be as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>To assess the Nature and determinants of energy transition in India. We shall examine the
                    effectiveness
                    of the policy measures in promoting clean energy production. We shall assess the implications of
                    phasing
                    out of coal on the coal producing states in eastern India and suggest appropriate policy measures.
                </li>
                <li>To examine the reasons behind the low transition rate of tribal children to higher and technical
                    education in the eastern Indian states. We shall examine the association between the access to
                    infrastructure, implementation of Forest Rights Act and the educational achievement of tribal
                    children.
                    We shall examine the effectiveness of technological intervention such as (ICT) for tribal education
                    and
                    suggest measures to improve them.
                </li>
                <li> To examine the sectoral innovation structure in energy transition and tribal education. To evaluate
                    the
                    innovations taking place in the field of energy transition and tribal education and suggest
                    necessary
                    policy recommendations to strengthen the sectoral innovation systems. The DST CPR will critically
                    evaluate the policy interventions, interact with all stakeholders (researchers, manufacturers,
                    sellers,
                    and end users) to come up with appropriate policy suggestions.
                </li>
                <li>To leverage data science in understanding large heterogeneous data and identifying correlations
                    between
                    them. We shall use machine learning techniques to find the indicators as well as impacts of the
                    policies
                    on energy transition as well as suggest new policy measures based on the feedback received.
